    <p>Lucas Goulart Salman, São Paulo, July 23, 2000. I am a Brazilian front-end developer, currently working at Engineering Brasil.</p>
    <p>I started with technology in 2020, after finishing high school, I started higher education in Technology in information technology management, in-person course.</p> 
    <p>In 2023 after finishing and graduating in management, I discovered what really interested me, programming.</p>
    <p> At that time, I was working at a security company as an access controller. I challenged myself to join a JavaScript course at Trybe. The studies were intense, comprehending 6 months of JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with a lot of dedication.</p>
    <p>In 2022, at the end of August, I had an opportunity at Engineering Brasil, where I am currently working for one of the largest clients in Latin America, Sabesp. Proud to have been part of the front-end of the new Virtual Agency – Sabesp.</p>
    <p>At Engineering I acquired knowledge such as Mobile Responsive, Angular Accessibility, among other frameworks!</p>
    <p>I currently work with Angular and interactions with servers. I really like doing personal projects, my hobby is programming! I'm currently studying Angular Cli on Udemy.</p>
    <p>In 2023, I had the pleasure of developing a website, with the aim of dropping artist Atlan Coelho's NoSilence NFT collection. Through this medium I became interested in decentralized systems, focused on the area of ​​blockchain technology.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about technology and I am ready for any challenge, always seeking to acquire new knowledge and practices that technology brings us.</p>
